# TRoco

TRoco is a generative algorithm for the composition of music based on jazz music theory and driven by an input of musical tension over time.

The algorithm includes a method for the abstraction and analysis of musical structures based on jazz theory, as well as the application of the method to produce chord sequences with a desired tension-release contour. A TRQ, or Tension/Release Quotient, drives generation via a best-fit algorithm. A simplified interface for the algorithm is available via an interactive webpage.
